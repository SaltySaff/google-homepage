Introduction:

This project will consist of a recreation of the google homepage using HTML and CSS.
The aim of this project is to make use of the HTML and CSS skills I have learned so 
far and challenge myself to recreate the google homepage as it appears for me at the 
moment. This challenge will focus on style instead of function, with the end product
being a replication of the google homepage, but not necessarily having any of the 
function of it (it won't be able to do any searches, the links won't lead anywhere etc.)

Aims:
1. Build the google homepage.
2. Practice the HTML and CSS skills I have learned up until this point.
3. Challenge myself, but not have unrealistic expectations.
